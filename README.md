# Hardware-Accelerated Binary Perceptron

This project implements a binary perceptron model using three different approaches: Python, C++ (High-Level Synthesis), and VHDL. The purpose is to compare the performance, ease of implementation, and hardware efficiency across these methods. The project is designed for FPGA-based hardware acceleration and was developed as part of the **ENGG3050** course.

## Overview
The perceptron is a fundamental building block of neural networks, primarily used for binary classification tasks. This project explores:
- A Python-based simulation for algorithm validation.
- A C++ implementation for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) targeting FPGAs.
- A VHDL implementation for direct hardware description and deployment.

---

## Features
- **Python:** High-level simulation for ease of understanding and debugging.
- **C++ HLS:** Hardware synthesis using Vivado HLS for FPGA acceleration.
- **VHDL:** Highly optimized implementation for FPGA deployment.

## Usage

### Python Simulation
1. Navigate to the `Python` directory.
2. Open `python_perceptron.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells to simulate and visualize the perceptron behavior.

### C++ High-Level Synthesis
1. Navigate to the `C++` directory.
2. Open the Vivado HLS tool.
3. Import `perceptron_top.cpp`, `classifier.cpp`, and `classifier.h`.
4. Run the synthesis process to generate hardware description files.
5. Use `tb_classifier.cpp` as a testbench to validate the logic.

### VHDL Implementation
1. Navigate to the `VHDL` directory.
2. Open Vivado and create a new project targeting your FPGA (e.g., Xilinx Arctix A7).
3. Import `perceptron.vhd` and `perceptron_tb.vhd`.
4. Run simulations to verify the logic.
5. Synthesize and deploy the design onto the FPGA.

## Performance Comparison

| Implementation | Speed (Clock Cycles) | Ease of Implementation | Comments                          |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Python         | N/A (Simulated)      | High                    | Best for initial algorithm testing. |
| C++ (HLS)      | Moderate             | Medium                  | Easy to code but less efficient in hardware. |
| VHDL           | Fastest              | Low                     | Highly efficient for hardware but complex to develop. |
